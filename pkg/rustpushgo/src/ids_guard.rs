// Fault-isolating seam for IDS key lookups.
//
// Every IDS lookup the bridge makes goes through `IdentityManager::cache_keys`,
// which chunks the URI list by 18 and, when Apple answers a chunk with
// web-tunnel status 5206, retries by splitting that chunk in half
// (`ids/user.rs:981-988`). The split computes its chunk size as
// `query.len() / 2`, so a list that is already down to a single URI produces
// `chunks(0)` and panics with "chunk size must be non-zero". uniffi catches
// the panic and the generated Go binding re-panics, taking the bridge down.
//
// That is reachable two ways: a big list halving until it bottoms out on one
// URI, or a list that was one URI to begin with (`cache_keys_once` filters
// participants through `does_not_need_refresh` before chunking, so a warm
// cache routinely leaves exactly one handle to fetch).
//
// This module contains the blast radius WITHOUT changing the shape of IDS
// traffic on the success path — which matters, because Apple rate-limits
// lookups and the StatusKit paths that depend on them are regression-prone:
//
//   * The first attempt is always the caller's full target list, one call,
//     identical to calling `cache_keys` directly. If it succeeds, nothing
//     about the wire behavior differs from before this module existed.
//   * Bisection happens ONLY after a panic. An ordinary `Err` (auth failure,
//     timeout, IDS status) is recorded and does not fan out into more
//     queries — amplifying a 6005 into N lookups would be its own bug.
//   * Handles that panic at size 1 are quarantined in memory so a pass does
//     not re-derive the same poison handle on every cycle.
//
// The quarantine is deliberately NOT persisted. A transient Apple failure
// that got a legitimate handle quarantined across restarts would silently
// degrade presence for that contact indefinitely; a process-lifetime TTL
// self-heals on restart at a cost of one bisection per boot.
