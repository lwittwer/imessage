// network work is what keeps the ~98% of sends that are not carrier-flagged at
// exactly zero added IDS cost — for them it is one map read and a return.
//
// Only 1:1 carrier-flagged DMs qualify. Everything else proceeds untouched:
//
//   - Non-carrier portals are the overwhelming majority.
//   - Groups are excluded deliberately, and this is not a gap to be closed later.
//     A carrier group is keyed by its participant list while an iMessage group is
//     keyed by gid:, so "repairing" one is a portal re-ID, not a flag flip — a far
//     riskier operation than anything here. 34fcec8a, d3c97272 and 60987f80 all
//     exist to keep carrier groups' flag *set* and their keying stable.
//   - Portals whose ID still carries a raw "(smsft)"-style suffix are excluded
//     because isPortalSMS documents them as unable to ever transition to
//     iMessage. This costs no coverage: migrateSmsSuffixPortals (client.go:959)
//     re-IDs them to the stripped form at startup, after which they arrive here

// checkCarrierRoute reports whether THIS ONE outbound message should be routed
// over iMessage even though its portal is flagged carrier.
//
// A portal is flagged carrier by CloudKit sync, chat.db migration or a live
// inbound SMS — all inbound- or sync-driven — and nothing re-derives it on the
// way out, because the carrier send path never queries the recipient's keys at
// all: rustpush addresses a carrier message to our *own* handle on
// com.apple.private.alloy.sms (messages.rs get_send_participants). So the flag
// sticks until the peer happens to message first.
//
// That is how a message disappears. Text-message forwarding is switched on for a
// while, real carrier conversations are created and their portals flagged, then
// forwarding is switched off — and every later send to those portals is still
// addressed to a relay that no longer exists. Apple accepts the push, the bridge
// returns a UUID, Matrix shows a checkmark, and nothing was delivered.
//
// # Why this returns a value instead of clearing the flag
//
// An earlier version cleared the portal's carrier flag outright, in memory and in
// the portal row. That is durable, portal-wide state, and every retro-active
// handler — edit, unsend, reaction, reaction-remove — reads it through
// portalToConversation. So one ordinary text send silently changed what those
// operations did: a reaction that used to go out as relay text the recipient
// actually received became a tapback against a GUID their device never held, and
// an unsend's honest "not supported for SMS conversations" refusal became a
// silent no-op that still redacted the Matrix event. Removing those handlers'
// calls did not help, because the flag write was upstream of all of them.
//
// The evidence this check gathers is only good enough for the message in hand.
// "The peer's handle is registered on iMessage" says nothing about which service
// carried some earlier message, which is what a retro-active operation needs (and
// which cloud_message.service already records, for whoever fixes those paths).
// So the answer is applied to one send and nothing is persisted.
//
// This never blocks or refuses a send. It can add latency: the rate gate is slept
// on synchronously, up to its interval times the queue depth.
