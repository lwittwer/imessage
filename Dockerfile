# mautrix-imessage-v2 — Docker image
#
# Built and published by CI (.github/workflows/docker.yml) to
# ghcr.io/lrhodin/imessage. End users pull from GHCR; local builds are
# not a supported user path.
#
# Stage 1 (builder) runs `make build`, which triggers ensure-rustpush-source
# in the Makefile. That clones OpenBubbles/rustpush at the pinned SHA
# (third_party/rustpush-upstream.sha) and applies every overlay + sed patch.
# Result: bridge binary contains the same patched rustpush as bare-Linux.
#
# Stage 2 (runtime) is bookworm-slim + the runtime closures (libolm3 etc.)
# + the Apple Root CA + the two existing install scripts.

# Layered copy so the expensive Rust/Go build below is NOT invalidated by edits
# to runtime scripts (docker-entrypoint.sh, healthcheck.sh, install-*.sh), docs,
# or anything outside the actual compile inputs. The runtime stage copies those
# files straight from the build context, so the builder never needs them. We
# also deliberately omit .git — it changes on every commit and would bust the
# whole build; the commit is injected via the GIT_COMMIT build-arg at the final
# (cheap) link step instead.

# Stub bootstrap-linux.sh: check-deps-linux runs it to install host deps, but
# every dep is already in the apt layer above (its dedup also mis-handles an
# empty list, and there's no sudo in the builder). A no-op stub is cleaner.

# Runs immediately after the clone+patch and before any Rust/Go build, so a
# missing patch fails the build fast (not after the expensive compile) and this
# check caches in the clone tier instead of re-running on every Go edit. Mirrors
# the `verify-rustpush-patches` job in .github/workflows/ci.yml so the image
# can't ship a binary missing one of these patches — which would happen silently
# if upstream reworded a guarded line and the sed in ensure-rustpush-source
# skipped it. Fails the build if ANY marker is missing: the only safe failure
# mode for a binary that depends on every one of these overlays.

# ── Layer 2: compile the Rust static lib (librustpushgo.a) ──────────────────
# Keyed ONLY on Rust inputs — the rustpushgo crate + nac-validation (rustpush
# itself is already cloned + patched in Layer 1). A Go-source edit does NOT
# touch these, so this layer — and the expensive cargo build — stays a gha
# LAYER-cache hit across commits. That's the actual fix for the old "any commit
# rebuilds rustpush" 8-minute builds: previously the cargo compile shared a RUN
# with the Go build, so any pkg/ edit busted it, and it leaned on the cargo
# `--mount=type=cache` to skip the rebuild — but BuildKit cache MOUNTS are
# builder-local and are NOT exported by `cache-to: type=gha`, so on every fresh
# CI runner that mount was cold and rustpush recompiled from scratch. The LAYER
# cache, by contrast, IS exported by gha (mode=max) — so moving the compile into
# its own Rust-input-keyed layer means a Go change reuses the cached lib.
#
# `make rust` cp's the archive to /src/librustpushgo.a — committed to THIS
# layer's filesystem (NOT the cargo target cache mount) — so the Go layer below
# links it via the cgo bindings' `-L${SRCDIR}/../../` (= /src) plus the
# Makefile's `-L$(CURDIR)` (= /src). The cache mounts here only speed the
# compile itself; the shipped artifact is the committed /src/librustpushgo.a.

# ── Layer 3: compile the Go binary + bbctl, linking the prebuilt lib ─────────
# Only Go inputs are copied here, so a Go-source edit invalidates ONLY this
# cheap layer. RUST_LIB is already built and up-to-date: ensure-rustpush-source
# is idempotent (every patch is grep-guarded, so a re-run bumps no source
# mtimes) and nothing copied here touches the Rust sources, so `make build`
# skips cargo entirely and just compiles + links Go in seconds. GIT_COMMIT feeds
# only the Go version stamp — a new commit re-links Go, never rebuilds rustpush.
# The cargo cache mounts stay mounted as a safety net: if make ever does judge
# RUST_LIB stale, it's a fast incremental cargo pass, not a from-scratch rebuild
# (and the registry mount is there rather than failing offline).
