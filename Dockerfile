# mautrix-imessage-v2 — Docker image
#
# Built and published by CI (.github/workflows/docker.yml) to
# ghcr.io/lrhodin/imessage. End users pull from GHCR; local builds are
# not a supported user path.
#
# Stage 1 (builder) runs `make build`, which triggers ensure-rustpush-source
# in the Makefile. That clones OpenBubbles/rustpush at the pinned SHA
# (third_party/rustpush-upstream.sha) and applies every overlay + sed patch.
# Result: bridge binary contains the same patched rustpush as bare-Linux.
#
# Stage 2 (runtime) is bookworm-slim + the runtime closures (libolm3 etc.)
# + the Apple Root CA + the two existing install scripts.

# Non-root user with a stable UID/GID. Matches the typical first Linux

# the host works without chown gymnastics. Users on hosts with a
# different UID can override via `user:` in compose.
#
# HOME is /data on purpose — bbctl persists its Beeper auth state under
# $HOME, and the bridge user's "home" needs to be on the bind-mounted
# volume so credentials survive container restarts. This is the same
# directory the bare-Linux install puts state in
# (~/.local/share/mautrix-imessage), so paths match cross-runtime.
