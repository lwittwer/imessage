# mautrix-imessage-v2 — Docker image
#
# Built and published by CI (.github/workflows/docker.yml) to
# ghcr.io/lrhodin/imessage. End users pull from GHCR; local builds are
# not a supported user path.
#
# Stage 1 (builder) runs `make build`, which triggers ensure-rustpush-source
# in the Makefile. That clones OpenBubbles/rustpush at the pinned SHA
# (third_party/rustpush-upstream.sha) and applies every overlay + sed patch.
# Result: bridge binary contains the same patched rustpush as bare-Linux.
#
# Stage 2 (runtime) is bookworm-slim + the runtime closures (libolm3 etc.)
# + the Apple Root CA + the two existing install scripts.

# Build with BuildKit cache mounts. CI exports these as part of

# (~5 min saved per run once the cache is warm).
#
# Caches mounted:
#   /root/.cargo/registry         - downloaded crate sources
#   /root/.cargo/git              - git-backed crate sources
#   /src/pkg/rustpushgo/target    - cargo build artifacts (the big one;
#                                   rustpush builds here as a workspace
#                                   dep, no separate cache needed)

# We can't cache /src/third_party/rustpush-upstream/ — BuildKit would
# auto-create the parent on mount, and `ensure-rustpush-source` then
# refuses to git clone into the non-empty dir. Cargo handles those
# artifacts in pkg/rustpushgo/target anyway.
#
# `make build` runs ensure-rustpush-source → clones rustpush at the
# pinned SHA, overlays open-absinthe, applies every sed patch — then
# cargo build, then go build. Network is required during this step
# (cache mounts don't replace network access for git clones).
