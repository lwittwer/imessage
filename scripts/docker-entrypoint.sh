#                         otherwise print a hint and exit non-zero.
#   setup     — interactively ask Beeper vs self-hosted, then exec the
#               corresponding existing install script with IN_DOCKER=1.
#               Same as bare-Linux setup, just inside the container.
#   login     — re-run only the iMessage login flow.
#   aliases   — when EMIT_ALIASES=true, print a host-side alias block
#               (imessage-setup, imessage-logs) that the user can append
#               to ~/.bashrc / ~/.zshrc. No-op otherwise.

# gosu as the bridge user. Every subcommand below runs as bridge — the
